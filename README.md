# Building DSLs in Kotlin but in Scala

Companion code to the [Building DSLs in Kotlin Pluralsight Course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/kotlin-building-dsls), but written for the Scala user.

Examples use common Scala patterns of immutable values and pure functions to achieve similar results to those demonstrated in the course.
